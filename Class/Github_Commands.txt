Github Commands -- How to Upload Files to Github


1. git add [File/Folder name - make sure it's case sensitive]
  a. git add ./* will add all ~files~ in current directory

2. git commit -m " whatever u want to say "
  a. may need to give user email (git config --global user.email "email")
  b. may also need to give username (git config --global user.name "username")
Note: committing a file will save it locally on the computer, without github knowing about the change

3. git push
Note: pushing a file will upload the newest versions to github
