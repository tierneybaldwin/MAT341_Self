Notes on Terminal Commands

how to edit vi folders:

v is visual, idk what it does tho

i is insert, allows you to enter in notes like i'm doing now.. you can only use keyboard tho not mouse, i allows u to start editing

esc, button not just the letters, allows u to stop editing

i# jumps u to that line so u don't have to scroll

:w is write/save
:q is quit, to get out of vi
