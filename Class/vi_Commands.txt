vi Commands
typing vi [name].txt will create a new file, which you edit using vi commands


i(insert): allows you to edit the file/add notes. you can only use your keyboard/arrow keys to navigate the file, not your mouse.

esc (the button, not typing the letter): allows you to stop editing

i#: jumps to that line, so you don't have to scroll

:w is write/save, will save the current version of the file

:q is quit, exits vi, brings you back to the terminal
